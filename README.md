## üèÜ **Project Highlights**
#### **About This Project**

This project demonstrates **advanced AI programming skills** through a complete implementation of a Go-playing agent that competes intelligently on a 5√ó5 board. The AI combines classical game theory algorithms with sophisticated heuristic evaluation to make smart decisions in real-time.

#### **What is Go?**
Go (Weiqi/Baduk) is one of the world's most complex strategy games, famously more challenging than chess. Players alternate placing stones to control territory, with simple rules but profound strategic depth.

#### **Strategy Features**
- **Tactical Awareness**: Prioritizes tactical objectives (captures/threats)
- **Multi-Phase Gameplay**: Adapts based on stage - opening/midgame/endgame
- **Sophisticated Heuristics**: Evaluates position quality holistically
- **Game Theory**: Implements optimal decision-making

## üñ•Ô∏è **Technical Architecture**

#### **Algorithm Implementation**
- **Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning**: Reduces search complexity from O(b^d) to O(b^(d/2))
- **Dynamic Depth Control**: Adjusts search depth based on game phase and remaining moves
- **Heuristic Evaluation**: Multi-layered position assessment considering:
  - Material balance 
  - Positional value
  - Stone connectivity 
  - Shape quality  
  - Territory control 
  - Eye formation
  - Liberty count 
  - Group safety

#### **Game Logic Mastery**
- **Complete Go Rules Implementation**: Liberty checking, capture resolution, Ko rule
- **Strategic Pattern Recognition**: Identifies and evaluates Go-specific formations
- **Board State Management**: Efficient game state tracking and move validation

#### **Performance Optimization**
- **Targetted Improvement**: Code debugged and optimized using the cProfiler module for better performance
- **Smart Move Ordering**: Prioritizes center positions for better alpha-beta pruning
- **Capture Priority**: Immediate tactical evaluation for quick wins

## üìà **Performance Characteristics**

| Metric | Performance |
|--------|-------------|
| **Search Depth** | 3-4 moves ahead (adaptive) |
| **Move Generation** | < 1 second per move |
| **Strategic Phases** | 3 distinct playing styles |
| **Rule Compliance** | 100% Go rule adherence |
| **Code Quality** | Extensively documented with AI assistance |

- Note: Copilot is used ONLY for DOCUMENTATION purposes. The rest of the code is self-written and implemented.
- The original code can be viewed by going to the first commit of the file.

## üéÆ Go Game Rules (5x5 Board)

Go is an ancient strategy game adapted here for a 5x5 board for faster experimentation:
- **Objective**: Control more stones than your opponent on the board
- **5x5 Advantage**: Faster games ideal for AI training and analysis
- **Placement**: Players alternately place stones on intersections
- **Capture**: Surround opponent stones to remove them
- **Ko Rule**: Prevents immediate recapture situations
- **Scoring**: Total stones value
